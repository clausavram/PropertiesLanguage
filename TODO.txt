1. change comment definition:
  - comments can appear only if the first non-whitespace character on a line
    is '#' (hash)
  - else, '#' is just a regular character, part of the key or value
2. add line continuation:
  - if a line's last character is '\' (backslash), right before the newline,
    the next line is parsed as being concatenated to the current line
  - a line containig no '=' and ending in a '\' will make the next line begin
    with a key
  - if a line starting with '#' ends in '\', the '#' will not have any special
    meaning
  - if the '\' follows a line's value, the next line will be a value, even if
    it starts with '#'
  - underline warning for line trailing whitespace after '\'

# for testing purposes, use IntelliJ IDEA's highlighting as a reference
