Right after cloning the project, if trying to debug the application, the following error occurs:

 | Visual Studio cannot start debugging because the debug target '...\PropertiesLanguage\bin\Debug\PropertiesLanguage.dll' is missing.
 | Please build the project and retry, or set the OutputPath and AssemblyName properties appropriately to point at the correct location for the target assembly.

what you need to do is change the project Debug settings and instruct it to start up a new experimental Visual Studio insance:
 1. Start Action -> Start external program:
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe" (or wherever it's located)
 2. Start Options -> Command line arguments:
    "/rootsuffix Exp"
